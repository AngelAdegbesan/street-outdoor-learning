    <p class="intro"> New York City has opened the streets for outdoor dining during the summer to save the restaurant industry from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The city is now doing the same for school children struggling with remote
      learning. </p>
    <p> The Department of Education is offering an Outdoor Learning program that allows schools to hold classes outdoors in schoolyards, adjacent streets, and nearby park space. The program is open to all public, charter, and private schools.
    </p>
    <p> Currently, there are fewer than 50 outdoor locations per 100,000 children in each borough, with Manhattan having the highest at 32 locations.
      Street learning would allow for a socially distanced classroom outdoors with low risk of transmission of the virus, as well as expanded access to in-person instruction especially for disadvantaged students.

          window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
            if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
              for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
              }
          }))
        }();
      </script>

    <p>With the number of COVID-19 infection and death rate spiking in the city and increasing remote learning difficulties, why aren’t more schools adopting this form of in-person learning that could benefit students? </p>
    <p> Experts say it could be because of budgetary reasons. For lessons and lectures, streets have to be set up with tents, chairs, tables or other difficult-to-move furniture. The furniture costs come out of pocket for each school’s
      administration.
